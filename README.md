# VirtualTourist

## Overview
The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

## What did I learn
* Use NSURLSessions to interact with a public restful API
* Create a user interface that intuitively communicates network activity and download progress
* Store media on the device file system Use Core Data for local persistence of an object structure

## Meaning for my career
The project gives me practice with powerful mechanisms for persisting data locally on a device. Storing media and retrieving it later is an essential skill for any iOS developer.
